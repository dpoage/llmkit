// Package agent is a tool-call execution harness: a reusable loop that
// drives an [llmkit.Client] through a bounded set of tools until the model
// produces a final answer, runs out of iterations, or exhausts a token budget.
//
// Callers with different roles (e.g. a coder, a reviewer, a researcher) all
// instantiate the same [Runner] with different system prompts and tool
// sets. The harness itself is provider-agnostic: it speaks only the
// normalized [llmkit] vocabulary.
//
// # Tools
//
// A [Tool] declares its schema via [Tool.Def] and executes via [Tool.Run].
// Tool errors are *not* loop failures: they are fed back to the model as
// tool-result content prefixed with "ERROR:" so the model can recover (retry
// with different arguments, try another tool, or give up gracefully). Only
// infrastructure-level failures (a failed [llmkit.Client.Complete], context
// cancellation) abort the loop.
//
// # Limits and partial results
//
// The loop enforces two limits: [Limits.MaxIterations] (model turns) and
// [Limits.TokenBudget] (cumulative input+output tokens from [llmkit.Usage]).
// Exceeding either stops the loop cleanly, returning an [Outcome] with
// Truncated set and the last assistant text preserved — partial results are
// data, not errors. Only context cancellation and infra failures return a
// non-nil error from [Runner.Run].
//
// # Transcripts
//
// Every run can be recorded as an ordered [Transcript] of events
// (requests, assistant turns, tool calls, tool results, usage). Transcripts
// serialize to JSONL and can be replayed offline through a [ReplayClient],
// which is the building block for the eval harness.

	// few turns with short stubs, preserving the task message, every assistant
	// turn (the reasoning chain), and tool_call/tool_result ID pairing. The
	// threshold then re-arms at a higher level so compaction fires at most a few
	// bounded times per run.
	//
	// Compaction trades cost against the provider's prompt cache: each firing
	// mutates the message prefix and therefore costs one full-price cache miss
	// that turn, after which cheaper append-only cache hits resume. It is a net
