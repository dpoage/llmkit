// fixedROAllowlist is the minimal, hardcoded set of host directories bound
// read-only into every bwrap sandbox so a bare-bones toolchain (a shell, libc,
// dynamic linker, core utilities) is reachable. This is intentionally narrow:
// broader binds (a whole $HOME, /root, or /etc) can exfiltrate host secrets
// through workspace -> transcript -> LLM even under network=none, since the
// untrusted command can read anything bound in and the sandbox output is fed
// back to a model. Toolchain-specific binds (go, node, python, ...) are
// layered on top via bwrapParams.toolchainBinds, never by widening this list.
//
// Bound with --ro-bind-try (not --ro-bind): non-FHS hosts (NixOS, Guix)
// genuinely lack /lib, /sbin, or even /bin as real paths — a strict --ro-bind
// on an absent path makes bwrap exit 1 before the sandboxed command ever
// runs, which previously failed EVERY run on such a host. A missing entry
// here just means that slice of the allowlist contributes nothing; it is
// still narrower than the container backend's baked image, exactly as
// intended.
//
// /etc/resolv.conf is deliberately absent here: it is added only when the
// network is enabled (see buildBwrapArgs), matching the container backend's
// contract that DNS resolution is unavailable under network=none.
//
// /nix/store, /gnu/store, and /etc/static exist for store-based distros
// (NixOS, Guix), where the FHS paths above are symlink farms into the store:
// /bin/sh -> /nix/store/...-bash/bin/sh. Binding /bin alone carries the
// SYMLINK into the sandbox but not its target, so exec fails with
// "execvp /bin/sh: No such file or directory" — which broke every
// SetupCmds-wrapped run and every /bin/sh-based capability probe on such
// hosts. Binding the store roots read-only resolves that class wholesale
// (shells, env, and the rpath lib closures of any store-resolved toolchain)
// without widening the secret-exfiltration surface: both stores are
// world-readable by design on their distros, so the sandboxed code gains no
// read access it would not already have running unsandboxed as the same
// user. /etc/static is NixOS's symlink-farm indirection into /nix/store
// (e.g. /etc/ssl/certs -> /etc/static/ssl/certs), needed so the /etc/ssl
// bind above resolves. On FHS hosts none of the three exist and the
// --ro-bind-try is a no-op.

// buildBwrapArgs constructs the argv passed to the bwrap binary for a single
// run. It is a pure function so the security-relevant flag construction can
// be exercised in unit tests without bubblewrap or a Linux host.
//
// Security posture encoded here (defense in depth for untrusted, model-driven
// code — mirrors buildRunArgs' contract for the container backend):
//   - --unshare-all             : unshare every namespace (user, pid, net,
//     ipc, uts, cgroup) by default; --share-net is added back ONLY when the
//     resolved network mode explicitly enables it (never the "none" default).
//   - --die-with-parent         : bwrap's child is killed if the sandboxing
//     process dies, so a crashed harness can never leave an orphaned
//     sandboxed process running.
//   - --new-session             : the sandboxed process gets its own session,
//     so it cannot inject input into (or steal signals from) the calling
//     process's controlling terminal.
//   - --clearenv + --setenv     : the sandbox starts with NO inherited host
//     environment; every variable it sees is explicit, mirroring --env on the
//     container backend. HOME=/tmp, USER=sandbox, and LOGNAME=sandbox are set
//     first as the sandbox's defaults, but p.env is rendered afterward and
//     DOES win on a repeat --setenv of any of them (bwrap's env map is
//     last-write-wins, exactly like buildRunArgs' --env HOME=/tmp — an
//     operator explicitly setting HOME/USER/LOGNAME in Spec.Env overrides the
//     default, not the other way around). USER/LOGNAME exist because the
//     tmpfs root has no /etc/passwd: bazel's client launcher hard-fails with
//     "FATAL: $USER is not set" without them, and POSIX tools generally
//     expect USER to be set.
//   - --size N --tmpfs / FIRST  : the root filesystem is an empty, SIZED
//     tmpfs, established BEFORE any subpath (--proc, --dev, --tmpfs /tmp,
//     the allowlist, workspace) is bound — bwrap applies mount operations in
//     argv order within one shared mount namespace, so mounting "/" AFTER
//     something is already mounted at a subpath (e.g. /tmp) shadows that
//     subpath's mount entirely: the new root's own (empty) /tmp directory
//     wins, silently making the "earlier" /tmp completely inaccessible.
//     Getting this backwards previously made HOME=/tmp — and therefore
//     every toolchain cache that defaults under it (Go, npm, pip, ...) —
//     unusable in every real run without ever raising an error. The size is
//     REQUIRED here too, not just on /tmp below: every
//     directory bwrap does not bind something else over remains part of
//     this writable tmpfs, so an unsized root is just as real a RAM-DoS
//     surface as an unsized /tmp when the allow-uncapped override is set.
//   - --proc /proc, --dev /dev  : minimal, namespace-scoped pseudo-filesystems
//     (no host /proc or /dev is ever bound), layered onto the tmpfs root.
//   - --size N --tmpfs /tmp     : writable scratch space for language
//     toolchain caches, sized like the container backend's /tmp tmpfs.
//     bwrap's --size flag applies to the SINGLE --tmpfs invocation
//     immediately following it, never cumulatively — hence it is repeated
//     before each of the two --tmpfs flags above and below, both driven by
//     the SAME p.scratchSizeBytes (sandbox.scratch_size_mb; <= 0 falls back
//     to fallbackScratchSizeMB).
//   - --ro-bind-try allowlist   : ONLY the fixed allowlist (fixedROAllowlist)
//     plus any resolved toolchain/extra RO mounts are bound in, read-only —
//     best-effort (--ro-bind-try) since non-FHS hosts genuinely lack some
//     allowlist paths, see fixedROAllowlist's doc. No wholesale $HOME,
//     /root, or /etc bind ever happens.
//   - --bind ws /workspace      : the workspace copy is the ONLY writable
//     mount. The original repo is never mounted.
//   - --chdir /workspace        : run from the workspace.
//
// Resource caps (memory/CPU/pids) have no bwrap flag equivalent — bwrap has no
// cgroups of its own — so they are applied by the caller wrapping this argv in
// a systemd-run --user --scope or cgroup v2 invocation; see bwrap_caps.go.
