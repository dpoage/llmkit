package sandbox

// toolchain.go implements host toolchain provisioning: resolving named
// toolchains (or explicit host directories) into read-only bind mounts, a
// PATH prefix, and provenance fingerprints. This generalizes the existing
// ROMount mechanism (previously used only for dependency-cache mounts) to
// host-installed TOOLCHAINS
// (node, python, cargo, ...) so a sandbox image that lacks a toolchain can
// still run it: the host demonstrably has every toolchain it needs to
// build/test its own targets daily, and mounting it read-only exposes that
// without granting the untrusted run write access or network egress.
//
// # Security posture
//
// Exactly the same as any other ROMount (see the package doc and
// ROMount.Shared): only PUBLIC, READ-ONLY content is exposed to the
// container — the resolved binary and the directory that holds its runtime
// dependencies (the symlink closure target's containing directory; for a
// nix-store or asdf/nvm shim layout this is normally already a
// self-contained, versioned directory). NEVER a secret or credential
// directory. Operators configuring host toolchains are exposing
// their own PATH's resolution of that name (or an explicit directory they
// name directly) to whatever untrusted, model-driven code the sandbox runs —
// audit accordingly, exactly as for any operator-opted-in mount.
//
// # Resolution algorithm
//
//  1. Each requested entry is either a bare name (resolved via the HOST's
//     `command -v <name>`, i.e. Go's exec.LookPath against the host PATH) or
//     an absolute directory path (used directly, no lookup — lets an
//     operator pin an exact toolchain install outside PATH, e.g. a specific
//     nix store path).
//  2. A resolved executable's symlink chain is followed to its final target
//     (filepath.EvalSymlinks) so nix/asdf/nvm shim layouts resolve to the
//     real toolchain directory rather than a one-file shim that would be
//     useless mounted alone.
//  3. The mounted root is the resolved target's containing directory, or that
//     directory's parent when the containing directory is named "bin" (the
//     common `<toolchain-root>/bin/<name>` layout) — this pulls in sibling
//     lib/ and share/ directories the runtime needs alongside the binary,
//     in one mount.
//  4. A provenance fingerprint (resolved host path + `<name> --version`,
//     run on the HOST, not in any sandbox) is recorded per toolchain.
//     Hermeticity is knowingly traded for provisioning correctness here; the
//     fingerprint is what keeps a verdict attributable to the exact host
//     toolchain build that produced it.
//
// # Contract for other sandbox backends
//
// ResolveHostToolchains is the single implementation of this algorithm, so
// resolution/fingerprinting/PATH handling never drifts between backends.
// Other Sandbox implementations (e.g. a bwrap backend) call it directly and
// translate ToolchainResolution.Mounts into their own bind-mount mechanism
// (this package's CLI backend renders them via Spec.ROMounts, same as any
// other read-only mount).

//   - an absolute directory path (starts with "/"): used directly as the
//     mounted root, no PATH lookup or symlink following.
//
// Resolution is best-effort per entry: a name that cannot be resolved on the
// host (not on PATH, dangling symlink, or a named directory that does not
// exist) is skipped with no error. This mirrors ROMount's existing
// best-effort ethos — a misconfigured entry degrades (the resulting
// CapabilitySet probe will legitimately report that ecosystem unavailable),
// it does not abort the run. Duplicate ContainerPaths (two entries resolving
// to the same mount) are de-duplicated; only the first is kept.
