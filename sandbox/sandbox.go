	// Workspace, when non-empty, overrides the fresh-copy-per-Exec default: Exec
	// uses this HOST DIRECTORY as the workspace directly instead of copying

	// removal). WriteFiles are still applied onto it via applyWriteFiles, so
	// repeated Execs against the same Workspace accumulate/overwrite files
	// exactly like repeated writes to a real working tree.
	//
	// TRUST: only pass a directory the harness itself created (e.g. via
	// MaterializeWorkspace) — Exec does no provenance check, so an arbitrary
	// caller-supplied path is trusted verbatim as writable model-code
	// execution surface. RepoDir is ignored when Workspace is set.

	// IdleTimeout bounds wall-clock time with NO observable progress (output

	// WriteFiles are files to write into the workspace before execution, keyed

	// ROMounts are additional host directories bind-mounted read-only into the

	//
	// Each mount is rendered as `-v host:ctr:ro,Z` and is NEVER writable. Both
	// paths must be absolute; empty paths and duplicate ContainerPaths are
	// rejected as an error by Exec.
	//
	// SECURITY: a read-only mount exposes host content to untrusted, model-
	// driven code. Callers must only mount public/cache content and never
	// secrets or private trees. See the package doc.
	ROMounts []ROMount

	// RWMounts are host directories bind-mounted WRITABLE into the container.
	// They exist for two callers: a caller-run dependency-prefetch step
	// (e.g. `go mod download`) populating a caller-managed
	// module cache on the host, later exposed to the untrusted network-none
	// run read-only via ROMounts; and an operator's
	// explicitly opted-in writable mount entry,
	// for tools that unconditionally mutate a
	// mounted directory at analysis/build time — the motivating case is
	// `bazel vendor`, which refreshes its bazel-external symlink and repo
	// .marker files inside the vendor dir (and, symmetrically, a bazel disk
	// cache) at analysis time; a read-only mount there aborts the run.
	//
	// SECURITY: a writable mount is strictly more dangerous than ROMounts —
	// untrusted, model-driven code can corrupt whatever is mounted. Do NOT
	// use RWMounts for a normal model-driven run's own scratch space: the
	// writable workspace copy is that surface. The operator-opted-in
	// case is scoped by operator discipline: point writable entries
	// only at caller-owned or caller-controlled directories (e.g. a
	// dedicated vendor/disk-cache dir the operator manages for the tool) —
	// poisoning tradeoff accepted is that a compromised run can corrupt that
	// directory, but the blast radius stops there: it is never a directory
	// shared with anything the operator (or another tool) trusts, so the
	// worst case is the tool's own next sandbox run reading corrupted
	// vendored state, not a wider compromise. Rendered writable on both
	// backends; on the container backend Shared=true suppresses the SELinux
	// :Z relabel exactly like ROMounts (host-owned trees the host also
	// manages must keep their context). Same absolute-path/uniqueness
	// validation as ROMounts; ContainerPaths must be unique across ROMounts
	// and RWMounts combined.
	RWMounts []ROMount

	// SetupCmds are optional ordered commands executed inside the container, in
	// the same network-none run, in the workspace directory, BEFORE Cmd. They
	// exist so non-Go ecosystems (npm, pip, cargo, etc.) can perform offline
	// package installation from a pre-mounted cache without altering the main
	// command.
	//
	// Examples: ["npm","ci","--offline"] or ["pip","install","--no-index","--find-links=/pipcache","."]
	//
	// When SetupCmds is non-empty the CLI backend wraps the execution in
	// /bin/sh: each command is shell-quoted and chained with "|| exit 125" so
	// any setup failure exits with code 125. Exit 125 is intentional:
	// internal/repro/interpret.go and patch.go both classify container exit
	// 125/126/127 as an environment_error, NOT a bug demonstration — a failed
	// "npm ci --offline" must never be misread as a successful repro. The
	// original Cmd is exec'd (via sh's exec builtin) so it retains its own
	// exit code and signal mask.
	//
	// Requires /bin/sh in the container image. Images used only for Go (the
	// default) set no SetupCmds, so existing images and behavior are untouched.

	// CaptureFiles are workspace-relative paths to read back from the

	// This is the seam structured-output ecosystems use: e.g. a pytest run
	// asked to emit `--junitxml=report.xml` writes machine-
	// readable results to a file rather than (only) stdout, and the caller
	// needs that file's bytes, not just the exit code. Each path is validated
	// with the same sanitizeRelPath rule as WriteFiles (no escaping the
	// workspace); a path the command never wrote is silently absent from

	// Shared, when true, suppresses the SELinux :Z relabel suffix on this
	// mount. Use Shared=true for host directories that are NOT owned exclusively
	// by the sandboxing tool — in particular, the user's shared Go module cache
	// (~/go/pkg/mod). On SELinux-enforcing hosts (Fedora, RHEL — rootless
	// podman's home turf) :Z recursively relabels the target to a
	// container-PRIVATE MCS label. That is correct for tool-owned dirs (it
	// isolates them), but catastrophic for a shared cache: it is slow on
	// multi-GB trees, breaks the host go toolchain, and breaks any other
	// container concurrently sharing the same cache.
	//
	// When Shared=true the mount is rendered :ro with NO label suffix. This
	// means the container accesses the directory under its existing SELinux
	// context. Under a strict enforcing policy the container may get EACCES if
	// that policy does not allow the container domain to read the host user's
	// home content. That is the correct conservative failure — a permission
	// error is loud and actionable, whereas :Z silently corrupts shared state.
	// Users who hit EACCES can opt in to :z (lowercase, shared relabel) by
	// labeling the tree as shared at the host level, or by moving the
	// directory under a tool-managed cache root that is safe to relabel
	// (Shared=false, gets :Z).

	// disk is making "progress" by the idle-stall definition (see cli.go's
	// progressSnapshot doc) and would otherwise run undetected until the
	// absolute Timeout, so callers that only check TimedOut must not mistake
	// a disk-filler for a genuine stall or a legitimate long-running build.
